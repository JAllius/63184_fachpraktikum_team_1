  abstract = {Tree boosting is a highly effective and widely used machine learning method. In this paper, we describe a scalable end-to-end tree boosting system called XGBoost, which is used widely by data scientists to achieve state-of-the-art results on many machine learning challenges. We propose a novel sparsity-aware algorithm for sparse data and weighted quantile sketch for approximate tree learning. More importantly, we provide insights on cache access patterns, data compression and sharding to build a scalable tree boosting system. By combining these insights, XGBoost scales beyond billions of examples using far fewer resources than existing systems.},

  abstract = {Understanding why a model makes a certain prediction can be as crucial as the prediction's accuracy in many applications. However, the highest accuracy for large modern datasets is often achieved by complex models that even experts struggle to interpret, such as ensemble or deep learning models, creating a tension between accuracy and interpretability. In response, various methods have recently been proposed to help users interpret the predictions of complex models, but it is often unclear how these methods are related and when one method is preferable over another. To address this problem, we present a unified framework for interpreting predictions, SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations). SHAP assigns each feature an importance value for a particular prediction. Its novel components include: (1) the identification of a new class of additive feature importance measures, and (2) theoretical results showing there is a unique solution in this class with a set of desirable properties. The new class unifies six existing methods, notable because several recent methods in the class lack the proposed desirable properties. Based on insights from this unification, we present new methods that show improved computational performance and/or better consistency with human intuition than previous approaches.},

  abstract = {Cloud computing and Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC), supported by technologies such as Docker, have shaped how many software systems are built and deployed. Previous research has identified typical issues for some types of IaC specification but not why they come to be, or they have delved into collaboration aspects but not into technical ones. This work aims to characterize the activities around two particular kinds of IaC specification—Dockerfiles and docker-compose.yml files. We seek to know how they can be better supported and therefore study also what approaches and tools practitioners employ. We used an online questionnaire to gather data. The first part of the study reached 68 graduate students from a study program on informatics engineering, and the second one 120 professional software developers. The results show that most of the activities of the process of developing a Dockerfile are perceived as time-consuming, especially when the respondents are beginners with this technology. We also found that solving issues using trial-and-error approaches is very common and that many developers do not use ancillary tools to support the development of Dockerfiles and docker-compose.yml files.},

  abstract = {A trend, accompanying the change of automation systems and their architectures, is the virtualization of software components. Virtualization strengthens platform-independent development and the provision of secure and isolated applications. Virtualization introduces well-defined interfaces to strengthen modularity, which facilitates the scalability of applications. However, virtualization includes additional software components and layers and, thus, additional computing costs. This additional effort can conflict with the real-time requirements of automation processes. Current research lacks the investigation of the time behavior of container-based virtualizations concerning their use in real-time systems. An assessment concerning real-time applications is required to prepare it for use in industrial automation. This article examines the effects of virtualization on the time delays of a software component based on Docker containers by providing measurements on a hardware testbed in a realistic use case. The experiments indicate that Docker virtualization can meet soft real-time requirements and can be used in industrial automation.},

By defining the specific Docker image architecture and building orders, dockerfile plays an important role in the Docker-based containerization process. Understanding the evolution of dockerfile and which dockerfile architecture attributes enhance dockerfile quality and reduce image build latency can benefit the efficient processing of containerization. In this paper, we perform an empirical study on a large dataset of 2,840 projects to shed light on the impact of dockerfile evolutionary trajectories on quality and latency in the Docker-based containerization. Based on the six categories of dockerfile evolutionary trajectories we discovered, we build two regression models to explore the impact of dockerfile evolutionary trajectories and specific architecture attributes on dockerfile quality and image build latency, which derives a number of suggestions for practitioners.},
